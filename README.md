# The Converter

A simple currency, weight, and length converter built with React and Vite beacuse I was just doing google searches whenever I was researching for international trips.

## Features
-   **Real-time Currency Rates**: Integration with Open Exchange Rates API.
-   **Smooth Animations**: Physics-based 3D tilt and direction-aware slide transitions.
-   **Searchable Dropdowns**: Quickly find units by name, symbol, or code.
-   **Dynamic Themes**: "Ocean", "Golden", and "Purple" themes that adapt to the active converter type.
-   **Smart Formatting**: Handles massive numbers (Trillions, Crores) with abbreviations.

## Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React, Headless UI, Tailwind CSS v4.
-   **Icons**: Lucide React.
-   **Performance**: `requestAnimationFrame` for logic, CSS transformations for UI.
